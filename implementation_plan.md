# Implementation Plan for Idle & Incremental Game Features

This plan outlines the steps to implement the features described in the provided document, with an emphasis on modular code design, including the requested character creation feature.

1.  **Project Initialization and Core Structure**
    *   Set up the basic project environment (e.g., choose a game engine or framework).
    *   Define a clear directory structure to separate concerns (e.g., `core/`, `ui/`, `features/`, `data/`).
    *   Implement the main game loop and update mechanism.
    *   Create a central game state manager to hold all relevant data.

2.  **Character Creation**
    *   Design and implement a system for players to create and customize their character.
    *   Define initial character attributes and appearance options.

3.  **Core Gameplay Mechanics**
    *   **Automated Progression:** Implement a system for generating resources over time, even when the game is not actively played (this will tie into offline earnings later).
    *   **Simple Interactions:** Implement a basic click/tap mechanism to trigger initial resource generation or actions.
    *   **Offline Earnings:** Develop a system to calculate and award resources based on the time elapsed since the last active session.
    *   **Exponential Growth:** Design the resource generation and costs to scale exponentially.

4.  **Resource Management**
    *   Create a system to manage multiple types of in-game currencies and resources.
    *   Implement resource generators (units, buildings, etc.) that produce resources at a defined rate.
    *   Develop a basic system for strategic allocation, allowing players to spend resources on upgrades or generators.

5.  **Progression Systems (Basic)**
    *   **Upgrade Paths:** Implement a basic upgrade system that increases resource generation rates or reduces costs.
    *   **Milestone Rewards:** Define and implement simple milestones that grant bonuses upon completion.

6.  **Blade Idle Specific Features (Initial)**
    *   **Character Progression:** Implement a basic character level and experience system, building upon the character created in step 2.
    *   **Equipment System:** Create a simple system for equipping items that provide stats or bonuses to the character.

7.  **User Engagement (Basic)**
    *   **Achievements:** Implement a basic achievement system to track player progress and award simple bonuses.
    *   **Daily Rewards:** Set up a system for players to claim rewards for logging in daily.

8.  **Visual and Audio Design (Placeholder)**
    *   Implement basic visual feedback for key actions (e.g., resource gain).
    *   Add placeholder audio cues.

9.  **Monetization Strategies (Placeholder)**
    *   Add placeholders or stubs for future monetization features like microtransactions and ads.

10. **Refinement and Expansion**
    *   Flesh out existing features (e.g., add more complex upgrade paths, different types of generators).
    *   Implement more advanced progression systems (Prestige Mechanics, Skill Trees).
    *   Develop more detailed User Engagement features (Narrative Elements, Social Features like Leaderboards).
    *   Implement the remaining Blade Idle specific features (Skill Development, Dungeon Exploration, Pet Companions, Guild Participation).
    *   Integrate actual Visual and Audio Design assets.
    *   Implement the chosen Monetization Strategies.

## Modular Design Approach:

Throughout the implementation, each major feature category (Core Gameplay, Resources, Progression, UI, Character, etc.) should reside in its own set of files or modules. For example:

*   `core/game_loop.js`
*   `core/offline_earnings.js`
*   `character/character_creation.js`
*   `character/character.js`
*   `character/equipment.js`
*   `resources/resource_manager.js`
*   `resources/generators.js`
*   `progression/upgrades.js`
*   `progression/milestones.js`
*   `ui/ui_manager.js`
*   `ui/resource_display.js`

This separation will make it easier to update, debug, and expand specific parts of the game independently.
